                    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The extracts in this anthology are taken from Shri Sat Charitra. They comprise parts of Chapters in which the author, Shri Govind Raghunath Dabolkar alias Hemadpant refers to Saibaba his devotees and vision.</p>
                    <p>Shri Sai Baba is revered as one of the greatest saints ever seen in India, endowed with unprecedented powers, and is worshipped as a God incarnate. (SAI meaning Sakshaat Ishwar) - GOD THE ABSOLUTE</p>
                    <p>This mysterious Fakir first made his appearance in Shirdi as a youth and remained there throughout his long life. HE transformed the lives of those who met him and continuously is doing so even after his Samadhi in 1918 for those whose hearts are touched by his love and who pray and call him at any emergency in life for his blessings.</p>
                    <p>Baba stated that his mission is to “Give Blessings” without discrimination to all, and he proves it in myriad ways by healing the sick, saving lives, protecting the vulnerable, averting accidents, granting offspring, facilitating financial gain, bringing people into harmony within themselves and with each other and, above all, in effecting the spiritual evolution and transformation of those who came to him as the last resort.</p>
